    - Release date: 2012.04.16
    - A rash of performance improvements to DogStatsApi's stats collection
      methods.
    - DogStatsApi's metrics collection and flushing can now be disabled with
      a configuration change.

    - This release is a backwards incompatible rewrite of the library.
